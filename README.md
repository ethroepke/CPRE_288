## Embedded C Programming Course - 2880 Iowa State

Course Overview

This repository contains lab exercises and projects from my Embedded C Programming course. The course focuses on the fundamentals of programming embedded systems using C, including interrupt handling, memory-mapped I/O, and real-time constraints.

This repository specifically includes all the code related to our Roomba project, where we applied our knowledge of embedded systems to create functionalities for the robot vacuum.

Key Topics Covered:
Embedded C Programming: Writing efficient code for embedded systems using the C programming language.
Interrupt Handling: Understanding and implementing interrupt service routines (ISRs) to handle asynchronous events.
Memory-Mapped I/O: Utilizing memory-mapped input/output to interact with hardware devices.
Embedded Design Flow and Methodology: Learning the design methodologies specific to embedded systems development.
Timers and Scheduling: Implementing timers and understanding scheduling mechanisms for real-time applications.
Resource Allocation and Optimization: Techniques for efficient resource management and optimization in embedded systems.
State Machine-Based Controllers: Designing state machines to manage complex control logic in embedded applications.
Real-Time Constraints: Addressing timing constraints and ensuring system responsiveness in real-time applications.
